Your AI coding tutor for YouTube tutorials.

Point it at a video. It reads the content deeply, asks you the right questions, and guides you through building the project — chapter by chapter.

---

## How it works

1. **Ingest** — Poiesis reads the tutorial video and extracts chapters, stack, concepts, and prereqs.
2. **Tutor session** — Your AI agent becomes a knowledgeable guide for this specific video. It asks you questions, recommends patterns, and corrects wrong assumptions in real time.
3. **Lab** — A local project is scaffolded. Each chapter gets a lab doc with exercises and guidance. You write the code; the agent tutors you through it.
