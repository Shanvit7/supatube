A [pi](https://pi.earendil.works) extension that turns any YouTube coding tutorial into a hands-on, test-driven build session.

Pi reads the video, profiles your existing experience, and codes through it chapter by chapter — running every step itself, explaining each decision, and making sure you understand what's being built and why.

## Features

- **One command** — `/poiesis` does everything: onboard, scaffold, and run chapters
- **Profile-aware** — scans your GitHub repos to calibrate depth, skips what you already know
- **Dual ingestion** — feeds the YouTube URL to Gemini for deep analysis when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; falls back to YouTube transcript extraction automatically when no key is available
- **Strict TDD flow** — Pi writes the tests; you never write tests. Chapters cannot be marked done until tests are green
- **Interactive test-plan review** — a full-screen TUI dialog lets you approve, add, or trim checkpoints before a single test is written
- **Command review gate** — every shell command Pi wants to run is intercepted and shown to you first: run, steer, skip, or ask for an explanation
- **Theory quizzes** — wrong answers are implemented and run so you see the failure before the fix
- **Prerequisite gate** — if a chapter's tech is new to you, Pi runs a short primer before the chapter starts
- **Session-safe** — chapter state persists across context compactions; Pi picks up exactly where it left off

---



## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@shanvit7/poiesis
```

A Gemini API key is **optional** — get one free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for richer analysis:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here   # optional
```

Without it, Poiesis falls back to YouTube transcript extraction, which works for any video that has captions.

> **Free tier caveat:** The Gemini API free tier has no cost and no credit card requirement, but Google trains on your prompts. For private or sensitive codebases, upgrade to the paid tier or omit the key and use transcript extraction instead.

---



## Usage

Everything runs through one command:

```bash
/poiesis
```

Pi decides what to do based on context:


| Situation                         | What happens                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No profile yet                    | Onboarding — pi scans your GitHub and asks a few questions to build your profile   |
| Profile exists, no active project | Pi asks for a YouTube URL, analyzes the video with Gemini, and scaffolds a project |
| Inside an active project          | Pi resumes the chapter session from where you left off                             |


---



## What a session looks like



### Onboarding

Pi scans your GitHub repos (or you describe your projects if preferred) to understand your stack and background. This calibrates every chapter going forward — what to explain, what to skip, and how deep to go.

Profile is saved to `~/.poiesis/user-profile.json`.

### Project setup

Paste a YouTube URL. Pi analyzes the video — chapters, tech stack, concepts, and key takeaways — then scaffolds a project directory. When `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, Gemini watches the video directly; otherwise Pi extracts and analyzes the YouTube transcript (works for any captioned video):

```
<project-name>/
  .poiesis/
    chapters/
      .progress.json        ← tracks current chapter and test status
      chapter-index.md      ← video overview and chapter map
      chapter-1.md          ← concepts, learning goals, tutor notes
      chapter-2.md
      ...
  .gitignore
```



### Chapter session

Each chapter follows a structured flow:

1. **Prerequisite gate** — Pi checks whether the chapter's tech is familiar given your profile. If not, it runs a short quiz and primes you before starting.
2. **Theory and quiz** — Pi explains the core concepts for this chapter. Wrong answers are implemented and tested so you see the failure before the correction.
3. **Test plan** — Pi proposes what to verify, shown in a full-screen dialog. You approve or adjust.
4. **Test file** — Pi writes the test file. You do not write tests.
5. **Implementation** — Pi codes through the chapter, narrating each decision. You make design calls when asked; Pi handles all shell commands.
6. **Done** — Tests pass, chapter is marked complete, next chapter queued.

Pi runs all commands. You only answer questions.

## Command review

During an active chapter session, every shell command Pi wants to execute is intercepted and shown to you in a TUI review dialog before it runs:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════╗
║  Command Review                  ║
║                                  ║
║  npx vitest run tests/ch-1.test  ║
║                                  ║
╟──────────────────────────────────╢
║  > Run it                        ║
║    Steer                         ║
║    Skip — don't run this         ║
║    Explain first                 ║
╚══════════════════════════════════╝
```


| Choice            | What happens                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Run it**        | Command executes immediately                                              |
| **Steer**         | You type a correction (e.g. "use pnpm, not npm") — Pi adjusts and retries |
| **Skip**          | Command is blocked; Pi continues without running it                       |
| **Explain first** | Pi explains what the command does and why before re-proposing             |


Read-only commands (`cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`, etc.) are auto-approved and bypass the dialog.

## Project structure

```
~/.poiesis/
  user-profile.json         ← your stack and recent projects (built during onboarding)
```

```
<project-name>/
  .poiesis/
    chapters/
      .progress.json
      chapter-N.md
```

---



## Bundled extensions and skills



### @juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question

Registers the `ask_user_question` tool — a structured TUI option selector with typed choices and a free-text fallback. Pi uses this throughout onboarding and chapter sessions wherever a multiple-choice prompt is more precise than a free-form reply.

Source: [npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question)

### agent-browser (skill)

When Pi is unsure about an API, config shape, or error message during your session, it opens the relevant documentation in a headless browser and quotes the live source rather than guessing from training data.

Both are loaded automatically — you don't need to invoke them manually.

---



## Registered tools

The extension registers the following tools, which Pi calls internally during chapter sessions:


| Tool                        | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `poiesis_save_profile`      | Persists the user profile after onboarding                |
| `poiesis_confirm_test_plan` | Shows the test-plan TUI and captures the student's choice |
| `poiesis_run_tests`         | Runs the chapter's test suite and records pass/fail       |
| `poiesis_chapter_done`      | Marks a chapter complete — gated on tests passing         |
| `poiesis_prereq_done`       | Records the prereq gate result and fires the theory step  |
| `poiesis_theory_done`       | Fires the test-plan step once theory is understood        |
| `poiesis_tests_written`     | Records the test file path and fires the implement step   |


---



## Prerequisites

- `[pi](https://pi.earendil.works)` — the coding agent
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — optional; free tier available at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (no credit card, but Google trains on free-tier prompts). Without it, transcript extraction is used as a fallback.

---



## Local development

```bash
# Install from local path
pi install /path/to/poiesis/apps/pi-extension

# Test without installing
pi -e /path/to/poiesis/apps/pi-extension

# Hot-reload after edits (inside pi)
/reload
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome — whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, better prompts, or just improving the docs.

### Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue with steps to reproduce and the chapter/step where it broke
- **Feature ideas** — open a discussion; the best ones get fast-tracked
- **Code** — fork, branch off `main`, open a PR; see the dev loop above
- **Prompts** — the `prompts/` directory contains the step prompts Pi uses; improving them has the highest leverage
- **Eval cases** — `promptfooconfig.yaml` drives the evals; adding cases for tricky scenarios is incredibly valuable



### Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanvit7/poiesis
cd poiesis
pnpm install
cd apps/pi-extension
bun install
```

Run the evals:

```bash
cd apps/pi-extension
pnpm eval
```



### Guidelines

- The command-review gate must not be bypassable during an active session
- Prompts live in `prompts/`; logic lives in `src/`; keep them separate
- Open an issue before a large refactor so we can align first

All contributors are credited in the changelog.
